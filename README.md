# Capstone_Bike_Analysis_Project
# Introduction
	
  For the last few months I have been completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered on Coursera. Within the course I have gained an understanding of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) along with the necessary tools (Tableau, SQL, R) to clean and gather insights with each step of the process. Nearing the completion of the course I have been asked to create a Capstone Project in order to showcase an understanding of the analysis process and an understanding of the technical tools used throughout the process. As a result, I have completed my Capstone Project on the Cyclistic Case Study

# Case Study
	
  In this case study, I am assuming the position of a “Jr. Data Analyst” at a company called Cyclistic, a bike sharing company based in Chicago. Cyclistic, offers both Classic and Electrical bikes to members and casual riders. Members are defined as users who have annual passes. Casuals, on the other hand, refers to users who have purchased either a single day pass or a day pass.
